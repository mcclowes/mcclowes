broader changes in how we approach product development. Max now actively seeks

## What advice would you give this person to help them make the biggest improvement/s
in their leadership?

- I think Max's mentorship towards [his team] has let these
individuals grow and progress really quickly. Looking from the side it seems that
Max is very good with identifying key areas in his own and others' development.
- Invest in developing trust in peers - even if it means moments of frustration or jobs
being done worse than if he does them himself.
- Keep doing what you are doing, but make sure it is sustainable and you're not
spreading yourself too thin and risking burnout.
- Focused effort will go a long way. Sticking to the plans made with the team will be
helpful to the team. Remember that not everyone has the same background
information as you do.
- To make the biggest impact as a leader, Max could benefit from maintaining a
focused approach, especially as major initiatives get underway, allowing
engineering teams the space to execute effectively. Additionally, sharing his
thoughts more frequently - whether through a document or a FigJam board. This helps
make sure all involved are aligned as well as help others understand his ideas
more clearly.
