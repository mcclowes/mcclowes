_Engineering Manager @ Workshare_
Max has this rare combination of programming and design skills which makes for a great front-end developer. During the time he worked for me he delivered quality JavaScript code with particular emphasis to the styling. On top of that he also had positive contributions at a team level with excellent suggestions on tooling and team collaboration. Thank you Max for making our application more beautiful and easier to style.


### Francisco Javier Gómez Bellido
_Software Engineer @ Workshare_
I will be always grateful to Max, I joined the company being junior and he taught me and helped me with every issue I had, no matter if it was related to the code or the design, he helped me and will always help me.
Apart from that, Max is a very active developer who always brings new ideas and alternatives to the table, he is a very good profesional always worried about making the place where he is a better place.

### Mario Jimenez Calderon
_Software Engineer_
Max is an enthusiastic and open-minded developer who loves to work close to the design process and get involved into the technical details prior to the coding itself. We have been working together in the same team for more than a year and having Max is always so helpful when we talk about CSS issues or visual bugs because this guy is a beast on that matter!

### Peter Lin
QA Engineer @ Workshare
Max is easy to work with, and very friendly when approaching him with goal related tasks or questions. He is also patient while teaching and sharing his experience and expertise in JavaScript with the team.

### Orit Gal
_Urbaniser, Client @ Codogo_
Having the pleasure to hire Max for two distinct projects, I cannot stress enough his creativeness, dedication, and unique ability to push the design and technical boundaries of products forward. A true asset and partner to any business or cause, I very much look forward to our next collaboration

### Freddie Ridell
Co-founder @ Codogo
From the very first day of our Computer Science degree, when I worked with Max to build a toy robot, I have been consistently impressed by his creativity and problem solving skills. He has attacked each problem placed before him with skill and genuine interest.
Since starting Codogo with Max I've seen him grow as a manager, designer, and programmer. I look forward to working with him in future

### Brian Anderson
Product Champion @ Akkroo
Today Maxi comes to the end of his three-and-a-bit-month internship with Akkroo. His impact here has been *much* greater than we’d expected when we decided to take an intern on-board for the summer, and he’s even exceeded the heightened expectations we had after first meeting Maxi and learning what he could do for us.
I’m the first to admit that we’re a fairly disorganised bunch — even for a startup — and no-one more so than me. So we wanted an intern who could add real value to our business, while being able to run with concepts on their own. Maxi has satisfied both goals in spades.
His work on our marketing website has had an immediate impact, tripling our conversion rate on some pages (and improving it on all the others he worked on). He has also led projects to create interactive widgets to help with customer acquisition — marketing capability we’ve never had — built an internal tool which will save our sales team hours per week, and designed new marketing collateral for us.
His longest-lasting contribution may not, however, be found in his code, but in a thorough, end-to-end analysis of our current UX for new users. Maxi has dived into our analytics and used his UX nous to create a 30-page document detailing the holes in our funnel. He’s then suggested an alternative on-boarding flow which, to a man, everyone agreed would be a step-change improvement from our existing flow. Unfortunately, Maxi won’t be with us to see his ideas come to life, but they’ve gone straight into our roadmap. Maxi has also shown an interest in all areas of our business, which is refreshing.
I hope he’s been able to take away some good experiences (of the good and the bad!) into whatever he plans to do next. I’d certainly recommend working with him.
