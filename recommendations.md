# Recommendations

Below are a collection of recommendations taken from [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxclaytonclowes/).

### Zan Makarov
_Software Engineer @ Codat_

I was very fortunate to begin my career in tech working on the same team as Max, who had a significant impact on my development in both technical and interpersonal skills.

Max stands out as an exceptional leader who leads by example and ensures that every voice within the team is heard.
- During story-mapping sessions, he would present the required feature, actively listen, and encourage contributions from other team members—refining designs and requirements where necessary.
- He consistently communicated the product and company vision within the team and bridged the gap between product and engineering through his strong technical expertise and experience.
- When releasing new features, he encouraged team members to run demos, helping them strengthen their presentation and public-speaking skills.
- He played a major role in fostering a healthy and collaborative culture across the team and organization — always giving credit to colleagues for their contributions and highlighting their impact.
- He demonstrated creativity and adaptability in driving the adoption of AI tools within the organization, even winning an AI-focused hackathon.
- He led initiatives that helped Codat establish itself as an organization that frequently hosts technical writing and coding meetups.

Max has also temporarily stepped into other roles within the team when needed:
- Engineering Manager – conducting one-to-ones and supporting career growth.
- Product Designer – producing high-quality designs with ease and mentoring product managers in Figma.

Above all, Max has always stood out as a genuine, driven, and open-minded professional. He consistently brings energy, vision, and thoughtful, growth-oriented discussions to every environment he is part of.

### Andy Jackson
_PM @ Codat, direct report_

It has been a privilege working under Max’s leadership. Max is a truly transformational leader who empowers those around him to be bold, take initiative, and strive for excellence. His ability to foster both high-performance and a strong sense of trust within the team is something I will take and (try to) emulate in future.

Max’s coaching and mentoring skills stand out as some of the best I’ve experienced. In our 1-1s, we often delved into what great product craft and leadership look like. Max always listened intently, offered thoughtful advice, and challenged me to grow. His guidance has had a lasting impact on how I approach my work, particularly in balancing strategic vision with the practicalities of execution.

Max’s exceptional domain knowledge of Codat is another area where he truly shines. Despite being in charge of client experience, he went above and beyond in other areas - a great example being his crucial steer to add an SDK for Bank Feeds product. This ability to put himself in the shoes of our customers is remarkable and consistently led to impactful product decisions.

In team settings, Max’s contributions were invaluable. His exceptional product instincts consistently helped steer the team toward impactful outcomes, and his high-agency approach pushed us to take ownership, get MVPs shipped quickly, and iterate effectively. Max leads by example—whether drafting up designs in Figma, jumping on client calls, or unblocking the team with decisive actions, he is always ready to roll up his sleeves and contribute directly.

Max’s leadership has not only driven outstanding results but has also created an environment where individuals feel supported, challenged, and inspired. Any team would be lucky to have him at the helm, I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with him and hope to work with him again.

### Xavier King
_Designer @ Codat_

I had the pleasure of working with Max on a number of projects at Codat, in particular on the Developer Experience. Max made significant contributions to product and overall company. Max's data-driven approach and expertise with tools like Amplitude greatly enhanced our product development process. His ability to collaborate seamlessly with developers, designers, and stakeholders from all areas of the business was very impressive. Max's deep understanding of the company ensured that our products were always user-friendly and efficient. With his exceptional skills and dedication, Max would be a valuable asset to any company.

### Sacha Rice
_Lead Developer @ Swoop_

I had the pleasure of working with Max at Swoop. His passion, creativity, people management skills and ability to converse with stakeholders and team members alike is something that is rare. 

He has the ability to see every opportunity and challenge from multiple vantage points, a skill which few possess. It is these traits which when combined with his engineering and development experience allow him to design products which place the user experience and journey front and centre but also deliver for everyone in the chain from the stakeholders to the marketing team.

Max is an asset to any team and a truly genuine, caring and hardworking person whom I was fortunate enough to work with.

### Manuel Morales
_Engineering Manager @ Workshare_  

Max has this rare combination of programming and design skills which makes for a great front-end developer. During the time he worked for me he delivered quality JavaScript code with particular emphasis to the styling. On top of that he also had positive contributions at a team level with excellent suggestions on tooling and team collaboration. Thank you Max for making our application more beautiful and easier to style.


### Francisco Javier Gómez Bellido
_Software Engineer @ Workshare_  

I will be always grateful to Max, I joined the company being junior and he taught me and helped me with every issue I had, no matter if it was related to the code or the design, he helped me and will always help me.
Apart from that, Max is a very active developer who always brings new ideas and alternatives to the table, he is a very good profesional always worried about making the place where he is a better place.

### Mario Jimenez Calderon
_Software Engineer @ Workshare_  

Max is an enthusiastic and open-minded developer who loves to work close to the design process and get involved into the technical details prior to the coding itself. We have been working together in the same team for more than a year and having Max is always so helpful when we talk about CSS issues or visual bugs because this guy is a beast on that matter!

### Peter Lin
_QA Engineer @ Workshare_  

Max is easy to work with, and very friendly when approaching him with goal related tasks or questions. He is also patient while teaching and sharing his experience and expertise in JavaScript with the team.

### Orit Gal
_Urbaniser, Client @ Codogo_  

Having the pleasure to hire Max for two distinct projects, I cannot stress enough his creativeness, dedication, and unique ability to push the design and technical boundaries of products forward. A true asset and partner to any business or cause, I very much look forward to our next collaboration

### Freddie Ridell
_Co-founder @ Codogo_  

From the very first day of our Computer Science degree, when I worked with Max to build a toy robot, I have been consistently impressed by his creativity and problem solving skills. He has attacked each problem placed before him with skill and genuine interest.  

Since starting Codogo with Max I've seen him grow as a manager, designer, and programmer. I look forward to working with him in future

### Brian Anderson
_Product Champion @ Akkroo_ 

Today Maxi comes to the end of his three-and-a-bit-month internship with Akkroo. His impact here has been *much* greater than we’d expected when we decided to take an intern on-board for the summer, and he’s even exceeded the heightened expectations we had after first meeting Maxi and learning what he could do for us.
I’m the first to admit that we’re a fairly disorganised bunch — even for a startup — and no-one more so than me. So we wanted an intern who could add real value to our business, while being able to run with concepts on their own. Maxi has satisfied both goals in spades.  

His work on our marketing website has had an immediate impact, tripling our conversion rate on some pages (and improving it on all the others he worked on). He has also led projects to create interactive widgets to help with customer acquisition — marketing capability we’ve never had — built an internal tool which will save our sales team hours per week, and designed new marketing collateral for us.  

His longest-lasting contribution may not, however, be found in his code, but in a thorough, end-to-end analysis of our current UX for new users. Maxi has dived into our analytics and used his UX nous to create a 30-page document detailing the holes in our funnel. He’s then suggested an alternative on-boarding flow which, to a man, everyone agreed would be a step-change improvement from our existing flow. Unfortunately, Maxi won’t be with us to see his ideas come to life, but they’ve gone straight into our roadmap. Maxi has also shown an interest in all areas of our business, which is refreshing.  

I hope he’s been able to take away some good experiences (of the good and the bad!) into whatever he plans to do next. I’d certainly recommend working with him.
